# JetBrains-Academy--Simple-Banking-System
 
__Project overview__: In this project, I develop a simple banking system allowing a user to create a card, top up the card balance and make transfers. 

The project is mostly supposed to show how to work with databases and SQL within Python scripts.

The project contains 4 stages.
1. Find out what a credit card consists of.
2. Implement Luhn Algorithm to check the card number for validity.
3. Create a database and store your data in it.
4. Improve your system by extending its functionality.

The project is not aimed at ensuring the security of the banking system, all data in the provided database is fake and generated by the program.

I am grateful to JetBrains Academy Team for their hard work on making such learning projects and the opportunity to learn.
